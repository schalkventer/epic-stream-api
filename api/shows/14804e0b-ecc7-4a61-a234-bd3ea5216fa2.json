They try to sneak into the first-class lounge, but are caught - but she at least manages to steal an orange. Joey and Phoebe find that Monica and Chandler have tricked them out of the keys to the master apartment; Joey hopes a false gas leak alert will make super Treeger use his key, but he makes a fireman use an axe, and the wrecked door calls for a big lie. Rachel is finally ready to tell who the father is - the others say they already know, except daddy Ross, who thinks she just wants another passionate night with him. After blaming everything on the condom manufacturer - as neither he nor Joey ever read the notice they are only 97% effective - Ross promises Rachel full support, and of course proposes - which she turns down, as they aren't in love. She refuses to admit she won't cope on her own, although she can't even see their baby on the first ultrasound.",
