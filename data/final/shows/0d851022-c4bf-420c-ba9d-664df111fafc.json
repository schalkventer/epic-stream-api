What Basil does not know, however, is that the man is not a Lord but a confidence trickster who attempts to steal his collection of rare coins. As Basil's desperation to keep such an 'upstanding' guest increases, he becomes increasingly tolerant towards the man's behavior, only to have the guest arrested in a police raid on the hotel.",

With both Basil and Sybil out for the afternoon, they leave Polly in charge. She decides to have a nap, leaving the English-challenged Manuel in charge. When Basil returns, he finds a solid wall where once stood doors to the dining room and still no door to the kitchen per his work order. Sybil takes an I-told-you-so attitude and insists he hire a qualified builder to fix the mess, but Basil decides to get O'Reilly back to right the wrong, but he still makes a mess of it as well.",

He's ready to give them rooms on separate floors until Sybil steps in. It turns out that the couple know Polly but when he sees her coming out of their room - she was trying on a dress her friend had brought her for the wedding they would be attending - Basil begins to think everyone has gone mad. All that's left is for another guest, Mrs. Peignoir, to get tipsy and make a pass at him. For Manuel, it's his birthday and a night of celebrating takes its toll.",

All in all, he's working out quite well and they decide to have a gourmet evening on Thursdays to try and promote, in Basil's eye at any rate, a better class of clientèle. Kurt gets along well with everyone and seems to have a particular interest in Manuel. When the big day finally arrives, they find themselves with only four guests booked for the dining room - which Sybil puts down to Basil's advert in the local paper saying 'no riff-raff' - and there seems to be something about Kurt that André forgot to mention. It's pandemonium as a manic Basil tries to make up for their collective lapses.",
